How to run
===

Install Node.js packages for frontend and backend:

```
cd frontend/ && npm i && cd ../
cd backend/ && npm i
```

Now, we need to run the server and the client. You can do this in two different terminals.
Make sure that you are in the `backend` directory in each case:

```
npm run server
```

and

```
npm run client
```
